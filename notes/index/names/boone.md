# Name: boone

1 families · subject name · 1 carried by a title or a declaration · 1 by prose · 1 by bibliography author

A name page exists because a **title** layer (a family title in `overview.tex`, a manuscript directory name, the optional title of a statement environment) or a `main_results` **declaration** name carries this name. Those hits make it a subject. The prose and bibliography columns are listed as citation evidence: a body paragraph that mentions a name says the manuscript cites it, not that the result is about it. A name that never reaches a title layer has no page — it is a row in [`../names.tsv`](../names.tsv) with `role = citation`.

Prose counts: 13 capitalized occurrences, 11 of them mid-sentence, 0 lowercase. The mid-sentence count is what separates a surname from an English word; the rule and its measurements live in [`notes/names.md`](../../names.md).

## Provenance by source

| Source | Layer | Families | What a hit means here |
|---|---|---|---|
| `F` — Family title | title | 1 | The release named the family after it — the strongest subject evidence there is. |
| `M` — Manuscript title | title | 1 | A manuscript directory is named after it, so a manuscript takes it as its subject. |
| `E` — Theorem title | title | 0 | A statement environment carries it in its optional title, so a theorem is named for it. |
| `D` — Declaration | declaration | 0 | A `main_results` declaration name contains it, so a formalized statement is named for it. |
| `b` — Body prose | body | 1 | A capitalized occurrence in manuscript prose — a citation, not a statement of subject. |
| `B` — Bib author | body | 1 | An author surname in a shipped `.bib` — a citation, not a statement of subject. |
